This project utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically Logistic regression, Naive
Bayes, and Deep Learning, to predict the onset of Type 2 Diabetes based on various features such as
lifestyle, self-perception of health, disease history, and other medical conditions. An exploratory data
analysis was performed on a dataset comprising over 253,000 entries. To train the machine learning
models, the dataset was balanced in a 1:1 ratio between diabetics and non-diabetics. The results of this
project indicate that the Logistic regression algorithm outperforms Neural network and Naive Bayes
models for this particular problem.
